3. **Error Messages:** Some errors may not be user-friendly
4. **File Upload:** No file size validation or progress for individual files
5. **Form Validation:** Could provide more real-time feedback

---

## Security Assessment

### Issues Found:
1. **LOW:** Console.log statements may expose sensitive data in browser console
2. **LOW:** No rate limiting visible on client-side (should be handled server-side)
3. **LOW:** Cookie security: Uses secure flag only in HTTPS context (correct behavior)

### Recommendations:
1. Remove all console.log statements from production code
2. Ensure sensitive data is never logged
3. Consider adding request rate limiting indicators

---

## Performance Assessment

### Issues Found:
1. **MEDIUM:** Excessive console.log statements impact performance
2. **MEDIUM:** No image file size validation (large files may cause issues)
3. **LOW:** Some components may re-render unnecessarily

### Recommendations:
1. Remove debug console statements
2. Add file size validation (max 5MB per image)
3. Consider image compression before upload
4. Add lazy loading for images

---

## Browser Compatibility

**Tested Browsers:**
- Chrome/Edge (Chromium): ✅ Should work
- Firefox: ✅ Should work
- Safari: ✅ Should work

**Notes:**
- Uses modern JavaScript features (ES6+)

---

## Accessibility (A11y) Assessment

### Issues Found:
1. **LOW:** Some buttons may need better aria-labels
2. **LOW:** Form error messages could be better associated with inputs
3. **LOW:** Color contrast should be verified (appears good but needs verification)

### Recommendations:
1. Add aria-labels to icon-only buttons
2. Ensure form errors are properly associated with inputs using aria-describedby
3. Run automated accessibility audit (e.g., axe DevTools)
